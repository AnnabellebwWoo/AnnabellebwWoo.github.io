        <p>Belle Reve is a blog created by Annabelle Woo. Magazines and websites were my favourite mediums for learning about fashion, beauty, and current events. After frequenting my favourite sites like Vogue, Harperâ€™s Bazaar, and Into The Gloss, I decided to create a blog.</p>
        <p>Belle Reve was born to express all of my interests. Varying from fashion and beauty to baking and trying new things. I hope you enjoy digesting the content as much as I like creating it.</p>
