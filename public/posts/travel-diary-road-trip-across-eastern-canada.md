My fantastic brother, Sebastian, meticulously planned this fabulous road trip with my family. I loved exploring and learning more about Canada. 10/10 would recommend.

# Day 1: Montreal and Quebec City

Drove overnight and woke up to watch the sunrise in Montreal. Then we headed to La Banquise for some breakfast poutine. After that, we hit a market and Old Montreal to soak up the atmosphere. Got some coffee and bagels of course, then onto the next spot.

Walked around Quebec City and did some shopping (where I got some super cute sandals). After a long day, we had a classic Quebec dinner featuring elk, french onion soup, and tourtière at La Nouvelle France.

# Day 2 &amp; 3: Gaspé Peninsula

Day 2 featured a nice long hike with crispy fresh air. It was raining but we didn't seem to mind, it was too refreshing. Then a scenic drive led to a collapsed Perce Rock.

# Day 4: Shediac and Charlottetown

A quick stop in Shediac in the morning, then off for some Charlottetown seafood. An ambient walk along Victoria Row and some ice cream followed later in the day. Vi and I also picked out some super cute wooden postcards for our BFFs at home.

# Day 5: Charlottetown and Hopewell

Visited the Cows Creamery museum-type store (flagship? idk) for some more ice cream first thing in the morning. We then checked out the Hopewell rocks in New Brunswick. I didn't realize it then, but I was going towards a grave mistake. There was sticky mud along the shore and I enthusiastically decided I wanted to go to the shore. There was maybe 50 metres of mud and I slowly sank to my doom. It really wasn't that serious, but the experience was painful. It took so much time and my feet still hurt. Promise me that if you ever go to see the Hopewell rocks you never go to the mud. Or you WILL die. Okay then I probably slept in the car or something.

# Day 6: PEI Countryside and New Brunswick

On this day, we visited the Anne of Green Gables museum which I enjoyed more than I thought. It was so interesting to learn about Lucy Maud Montgomery, especially after doing that one Grade 10 project on her. But genuinely, I learned so much of her hardships and I have such great, newfound respect for her.

While driving, we had a quick stop and discovered the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. Obviously, we had to make some time to beach. After soaking up the sun, we wolfed down some more seafood at the great Quai Aboiteau Wharf Restaurant and Bar.

Ended the day by visiting a stunning sea cave at sunset.

# Day 7: Masstown and Cabot Trail

We started the day with an extremely scenic drive and some picturesque quick stops along the way. We then hiked the Cabot trail which was unbelievable. The steps follow along the side of a mountain. Along with the fact that it was extremely windy, I didn't dare to follow it all the way down. I was gripping to Vi the entire time but I loved the view. Very stunning, must visit, 10/10.

Completed the day by glamping in a dome featuring some smores.

We originally planned to keep going, but devastating storms in Nova Scotia cut our trip short. I was honestly relieved to go home after so many days. Overall I loved spending so much time with my family and I thoroughly enjoyed the breathtaking views.
