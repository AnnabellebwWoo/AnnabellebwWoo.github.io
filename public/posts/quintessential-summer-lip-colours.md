**Lip Sleeping Mask (Berry)**

This lip mask moisturizes your lips while looking so deliciously glossy. It completely represents the epitome of summer makeup. I'm obsessed with the berry scent for the summer.

**Glossier Balm Dotcom (Mango)**

This is also a lip balm like the Laneige mask, but a slightly less decadent version. I don't find this formula particularly hydrating, but the delicious mango flavour makes up for it. The packaging is adorable and easy for on-the-go. The shade supposedly has a peachy-rose tint, but I just find it to be clear.

**Tower 28 JuiceBalm (Shake)**

I love using this tinted lip balm when I want some colour. "Shake" is a juicy sheer pink. I also wouldn't reach for this if my lips were seriously dry. But I love it for its sheer tint and convenience.

**r.e.m. beauty Lip Liner Pencil (Key Change)**

During the day, I wear this layered with the Laneige lip mask to soften it. But if I'm going out for the night then it's nice to have a colour more potent. This shade is a dusty rose and is a great MLBB.

**Marc Jacobs Enamoured Lip Lacquer (Pretty Thing)**

This product is easily my favourite lip gloss by far. It's a pigmented, nude-rose shade with amazing shine. But it kills me because I'm pretty sure it's discontinued. When I first used it, I was expecting a warm, vanilla scent, but it's actually a refreshing minty smell.
