Today I went to Toronto to go shopping with my friend, Anthea. I rarely buy clothes all at once like this to budget control. But since splitting up with my sister for university, I have virtually no clothes for the colder weather. So what better than to make a whole day out of shopping. After lunch at [Le Sélect Bistro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gbTYCY4fU4aNBtU29), we headed to Queen St. W. I got my pieces below all from _Brandy Melville_ or _Garage_.
