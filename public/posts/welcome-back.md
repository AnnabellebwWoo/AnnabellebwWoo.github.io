Hello, and welcome back! It’s been so long,  almost 11 months, and I’ve missed writing here so much. So…  what has happened since then? 

To start, my  previous blog was hosted on WordPress for two years, but once my subscription ended I decided to code the website from scratch.  Although it took some time, I learned a lot in the process and I’ll share a breakdown soon  about the nitty gritty details on how I coded it. 

A lot has also changed in my personal life too since I’ve last blogged. I’m now studying Materials Engineering, which means you can expect some STEM content soon. 

I can’t wait to blog and create content that I genuinely love. Expect blog posts about my current beauty rotation, favourite music, hauls, and of course, materials science. I’ll also be coding new features and updates to the website as I go. I’m always looking for feedback, so let me know any questions, comments, or suggestions you have [here](https://forms.gle/DFDVVnunLK5V2Vug6).

Thank you so much for joining me and I hope to see you in the next one!
