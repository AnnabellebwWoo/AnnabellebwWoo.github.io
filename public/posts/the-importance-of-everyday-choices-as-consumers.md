Note: This is me speaking from my personal experience. Not everyone has access to cruelty-free companies or vegetarian options. I feel so grateful to have the privilege of these options.

Since becoming a vegetarian, people often ask me why I have chosen to do it. It honestly stumps me, because sometimes I'm not even sure. Going to university is a big factor though since my food choices are completely up to me. I don't even have to cook, I can just pick up any vegetarian meal using my meal card. A couple months ago, I learned that factory farming is also one of the leading causes of climate change. Another factor is that I wanted to better my heart health to be the healthiest, best version of myself. 

It ultimately boils down to the environment and animal cruelty. This isn't my first experience of "wait, why am I doing this?" Since the eighth grade, I have exclusively purchased makeup from cruelty-free brands. Over time, both food and makeup decisions feel like "why not?" Being a vegetarian and using cruelty-free products isn't hard at all. Many individuals feel that they're missing out when they don't eat meat or support certain companies. But once I eliminated them, I don't even notice it. It doesn't even feel conscious anymore when I'm reading from a menu or strolling through Sephora.

Even though it's just a couple of choices everyday for me as a consumer, they have big impacts in the long-run. I'm so fortunate to have these choices, it feels compelling to understand the power of them. For many, they don't have access to cruelty-free companies or vegetarian options. If you're looking for a sign to make some switch in your life, this is it. Take advantage of the new year and challenge yourself. You might be surprised by how easy it is.
