There's something about matcha that makes me feel so put together and instantly boosts my mood. Maybe it's the clean girl aesthetic, but matcha has numerous health benefits. Matcha boosts brain function, promotes heart health, is an antioxidant, and helps to enhance weight loss. But my absolutely favourite part is the little time I take for myself to make it. When I was beyond stressed during exam season, I enjoyed the comfort of the routine of making matcha. I have since perfected my recipe below.

# Tools 
- Matcha whisk
- Tea bowl
- Sieve
- Wooden spoon

# Ingredients
- Hot Water (1 tbsp)
- Matcha Powder (1 tsp)
- Milk of choice, I prefer oat (250 mL)
- Honey (1 tsp)
- Ice

# Directions
1. Dunk the matcha whisk in some hot water so its prongs are more malleable.
2. Add the hot water to the tea bowl. Using the sieve, add the matcha powder to the same bowl. **Make sure you're using wooden utensils when touching matcha in the container.
3. Whisk the hot water and matcha in side-to-side directions until frothy. Usually around 1-2 minutes.
4. Add honey to the matcha mixture and whisk until combined.
5. Fill a glass with ice and your milk of choice. Pour in your matcha mixture. Enjoy!
