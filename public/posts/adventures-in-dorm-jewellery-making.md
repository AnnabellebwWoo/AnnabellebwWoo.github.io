I always see everyone making their own jewellery on social media. So what better than to make my own? Except, I have no real idea of how to do it. Just a few collected charms, some chains, and a pair of tweezers in my dorm room. This was fun, but I'm never doing it again. I definitely didn't do it right because my fingers still hurt. Pros: custom pieces, cheaper, and a sense of accomplishment. Cons: takes some time and a lot of pain. Check out the final product below.
