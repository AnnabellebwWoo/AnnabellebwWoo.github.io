I had today completely to myself, free to do whatever I wanted. So I set out to have the perfect day doing exactly and whatever I wanted.

I started by sleeping in and having a slow morning. I didn't really have a plan but I decided to set out for a day in the town. I explored Westdale, first stopping at King W. Books. I found this store a little uninteresting; the selection was mundane and out of my price range. I then whisked in and out of a few other stores in Westdale. I didn't find anything that piqued my interest so I just kept walking along and enjoyed the sunny weather. 

I then came across another book store, Westside Stories. This place was definitely more my speed. They had a diverse selection of old books for great prices and I took my time sifting through each section. I ended with a haul of five books; ranging $4.00 at the lowest price point and $7.50 at the highest. From least to most expensive: _Zola_ by Therese Raquin, _Une vie_ by Guy de Maupassant, _L'Avare_ by Molière, _Circé_ by Madeline Miller, and _Emma_ by Jane Austen.

On my way back to my house, I stopped at Mikel Coffee for an iced americano and a pain au chocolat. I plopped myself down in one of the leather chairs and began cracking open my new purchases. I tried out L'Avare and I couldn't even get through the preface. So I moved onto _Une vie_ but I was lost by the second page. At that point I cleared my drink and pastry so I headed home.

After a little bit of work, I left for a hike to get some fresh air at Cootes Paradise. It was nice to be away from screens and get a sweat in.

I finished off the day with leftovers, a little more work, and laundry. It was nice to have an easy, slow day filled with my favourite things.
