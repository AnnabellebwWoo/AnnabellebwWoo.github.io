I recently made an order on Stylevana to re-up on a tried and true favourite and test some new items. I'm intrigued by other online K-beauty retailers like Olive Young and YesStyle, but I've stuck to Stylevana. I've heard that others have experienced shipping difficulties, but I've never had any issues. Now onto the haul — let's start with the restocks.

# _Beauty of Joseon_ Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics

If you've read my complete sunscreen breakdown post, then you know how much I love this sunscreen. To sum it up, it's the best I've ever tried -- easily a 10/10. I even bought two so I could give one to my sister.

Now onto the exciting, new stuff...

# _SKIN1004_ Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil

I've been using this for the past couple of weeks and it has already surpassed my other favourite cleansing oils. It's much thinner than what I'm used to, but that might be why I like it so much. It effortlessly removes my makeup and sunscreen buildup from throughout the day. After rinsing, my skin feels softer and not stripped. It's difficult to find a product so efficient without being overkill. The only downside is the citrus smell. Overall, a 9/10 in my books.

# _SKIN1004_ Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum

I haven't tried this sunscreen yet, but it's come with rave reviews from everyone I've encountered. 

# _Round Lab_ Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen

Similar to the sunscreen above, I have yet to try it. I'll let you know how I like it once I finish my current rotation.

# _AXIS-Y_ Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum

Honestly, I think it takes weeks before a difference in dark spots can be seen. But I can attest to how hydrated and glowing my skin looks. So far, I'd rate this an 8/10.

# _ANUA_ Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner

This extremely popular toner has been on my wish list for a while. Although I was incredible excited to crack this open, I decided to delay testing it while I stagger the implementation of my new products. I was worried about trying too many new items at once, so I'll let you know how I like this in a couple months.
