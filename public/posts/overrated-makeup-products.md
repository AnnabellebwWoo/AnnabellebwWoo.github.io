**Saie Airset Radiant Loose Setting Powder**

This product looks flawless initially. But after a few minutes, it makes your makeup look dry, cakey, and orange. I have the lightest shade but it never fails to make me look like a pumpkin.

**Kosas Wet Lip Oil Treatment Plumping Gloss**

Honestly an amazing gloss, but the product leaks absolutely everywhere. I even featured it in my "What's In My Bag", but it made a sticky mess in my purse after a few days. Great product, terrible packaging.

**Make Up For Ever HD Skin All-In-One Palette**

I was so excited to try this palette after seeing Hailey Bieber use the same one. But the formula lacks creaminess. It applies patchy and doesn't look natural at all.
