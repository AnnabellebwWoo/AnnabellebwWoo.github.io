As peak summer approaches, I've been extra generous with my sunscreen usage. Just this morning I ran out of my Beauty of Joseon sunscreen. As I went to grab my back-up I thought about all the sunscreens I've ever used. From the good to the bad, to the mediocre, here is a review of every sunscreen I've ever tried. At least the ones that I remember anyway.

# Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics

This is by far the greatest sunscreen I have tried post-accutane. Normally it would be too hydrating, but now that my skin has adjusted to a more normal equilibrium, I find myself reaching for this everyday. The extremely lightweight and blendable texture scores a 10/10 for me. The formula is elegant without skipping out on sun protection. With SPF 50+ and PA++++, there isn't much to dislike. However, shipping from Korea takes ages, so I stock up on multiple at a time on Stylevana.

# La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra-Fluid

In the winter time, I lean towards a more satin base instead of glowy. This sunscreen is great in achieving that. But if you're looking for a dry-touch sunscreen, this is easily the best. It leaves you looking non-greasy which I particularly desired pre-accutane. Although, sometimes I find my makeup pilling under this, so be wary if you like foundation and concealer. 

# Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen

By far one of the worst sunscreens I have ever tried. I used to use this when I was about 14, and my god did I look like a grease ball. While not a stand alone sunscreen, I didn't find it to be particularly protective or moisturizing. It's like hitting no birds with two stones. Maybe this would be better if you have dry skin, but I didn't find it compatible with my skin. 

# Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen

I feel like I had a love-hate relationship with this one. On some days I really liked how dry-touch it was. But if I went a little heavy-handed, then it would make me look greasy. Makeup also did not like to sit on my face. Concealer would pill off in strange ways and the smell was ghastly. Every morning it would make me a little nauseous applying this to my face. It had a mil dewy scent with notes of concrete. Overall, I wouldn't repurchase.

# COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream

I was very shocked my how disappointing this sunscreen was. I heard about rave reviews before purchasing. But I found it to be greasy and irritating. It caused my skin to flare up and become unpredictable — the opposite of soothing.

# Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence

Yet another disappointing Korean sunscreen. This also irritated my face, which I suspect is some astringent in the formula. It make my skin strangely dry and greasy at the same time.

# Supergoop Glow Stick Sunscreen

I would never use this all over my face, but its stunning as a natural highlighter. I love using it on the tops of my cheekbones and on my collarbones. I've been influenced to feel like [Sofia Richie](https://youtu.be/PrsRaITClF8?si=DSVV7XbtVHsXAJsG) every time I use this.

The Beauty of Joseon sunscreen trumps all and remains my reigning favourite. When I purchased it I also picked up the Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel, which I have yet to try. I'm thinking of saving it for the winter when I need that extra hydration. So if you've tried it, let me know how it is!
