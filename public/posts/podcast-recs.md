I've never really considered myself to be an avid podcast listener, but here are some go-to options and a new recent obsession.

# 1. Inner French

Learning french through immersion can be difficult at times, but listening to InnerFrench makes it easier. Hugo talk about genuinely interesting topics clearly and slowly. It's always my first option when I'm going on a walk or doing chores.

# 2. Breaking Beauty

[Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/show/0Hw7tGNE8effbgv9Siron2?si=f3a2ea34050749f8)

I've been listening to Breaking Beauty since high school. I love their episodes that focus on beauty company founders and their growth to success. Their complete rundowns on beauty companies are more interesting than just black and white reviews on products. In particular, their interviews provide and insightful behind-the-scenes look of running a business.

# 3. Founders

I was introduced to this podcast by my brother. I remember him chewing my ear off about this and he's probably listened to every episode. I really like their episodes on female founders. In particular, this [Estée Lauder](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7uDwSEN1W5IO9HpAObgJRc?si=0681e12208784b85) one is my favourite. I don't normally re-listen, but for some reason I keep revisiting this one.

# 4. This Is Not a Beauty Podcast

[Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ETpoAH48iIc1ASE0WjfAq?si=2ed8143fc5164322)

Now this is by far my favourite podcast of all time. I've literally only listened to two episodes, but it's exactly what I've been looking for. It's from L'Oréal Groupe, hosted by Isabella Rossellini. They discuss how beauty is not just a frivolous concept, but instead plays an integral role in politics, business, medicine, technology, and more. Also, try listening to it on Apple Podcasts, their UI is unreal.
