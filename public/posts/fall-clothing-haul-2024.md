As temperatures have been dropping, I've noticed my lack of appropriate clothing. This past Wednesday, I headed to Toronto to pick up some items from Brandy. Honestly, my closet mostly consists of Brandy and Aritzia, and I'm not afraid to admit that I have basic style. In addition to some winter fashions for myself, I've also picked up some Christmas gifts and a hair product from Lush. After shopping, I spent some time with my brother at 10 DEAN before joining him and his girlfriend for dinner. So glad I got to take a break from finals studying and clear my head.

# Brandy Melville

_Navy with White Tie Autumn Tie Sweatpants_

Amazing pants for the winter. I love wearing a pair of leggings underneath to stay extra warm. The length fits me surprisingly well, which I can't say for a lot of Brandy bottoms. For reference, I'm ~5'3 and they hit slightly long so I wear my docs or loafers with these.

_Light Grey and Grey Anastasia Sweatpants_

These were a new finds for me. I usually stay loyal to their other sweats because of their fit. These were my first brandy bottoms with a cinched waist, which I actually prefer because even if I don't tie them, they still stay up.

_Navy Ribbed Longsleeve with Buttons_

_Speckled Grey Long Sleeve_

_Beige Leah Top_

All the tops I got were just basic long sleeves, which I always love.

_Charcoal Grey Scarf with Tassels_

I've been on the hunt for a scarf, and I'm so glad I found this basic grey pick. 

# Lush

_Super Milk Conditioning Hair Primer_

I've long heard about this hair product, but every time I stop in the Lush store, I'm reluctant to make the purchase. I finally went for it, and I'm so glad I did. It smells incredible and works so well as a heat protectant and prevents frizzy hair. I've noticed my hair getting more flat and dry with the changing temperature, and this product brings life back to it.
