Summer makeup to me is about minimal and glowy layers. I try to wear as little makeup as possible because it's going to melt off anyway. Light layers also make sunscreen reapplications easier.

After a generous layer of the Supergoop unseen sunscreen, I start with concealer. Currently, I'm using the Kosas revealer concealer in 2.5C. I spot conceal and then move on to blush. I'm using the tarte sea breezy blush in pink sky. I apply that to a little above the apples of my cheeks and a little on my nose for that sunburnt look. To add to the glow, I use the Milk Makeup cream highlighter stick in lit on my cheekbones. For my eyelashes, I use the Shiseido eyelash curler and Glossier lash slick in black. To finish off the look, I apply the Laneige lip sleeping mask in berry. Lips change day to day, but depending on my mood, I reach for one of [these](https://belle-reve.com/blog/post/quintessential-summer-lip-colours/).
