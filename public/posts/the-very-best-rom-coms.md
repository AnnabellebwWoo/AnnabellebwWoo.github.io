Absolutely gut-wrenching. Every movie on this list is a must-watch.

# Midnight in Paris (2011)
- More rom than com, but this will make you want to fall in love in Paris. This movie is very visually stunning and a very cozy watch.

# Silver Linings Playbook (2012)
- Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are so weird in this movie but I have so much love for them. The ending makes me scream and cry at the same time.

# About Time (2013)
- More than love, this movie changed my perspective on life. It's such a comfortable and sweet movie.

# 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
- I love this movie as a classic teenage rom com.

# He's Just Not That Into You (2009)
- One of the best rom coms on this list. This movie feels so 2000s and has a completely stacked cast. It follows multiple women and their relationships. They're all so intertwined and satisfying to watch.

# Clueless (1995)
- Like 10 Things I Hate About You, it's a classic rom-com. It's one of those movies that are so good I can't watch it too frequently so I don't lose the star quality.

# EMMA (2020)
- This movie is so unbelievably beautiful. I didn't feel completely connected to this film, but I think it's worth the watch because of the aesthetics.

# Flipped (2010)
- Just cute first love. I love this movie when I feel particularly down.
