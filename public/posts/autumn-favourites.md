I've collected some of my niche favourites of the past few months. School's back and I've really fallen off of on my blogging. So what better than to catch up on some newfound loves.

# Brazilian Samba

A couple months ago, I tried learning Portuguese. I absorbed absolutely nothing, but Brazilian samba stuck. Even after giving up on Portuguese, I still listen to samba because it's just so good. It instantly puts me in a good mood. I highly recommend [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0LP2856tZ3A5r5x6Tccyoo?si=1de7bf2c127744e4) on Spotify. (also check out [my Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/annabellewoo911?si=df49e08173ef4d65)!)

# Neighbourhood Walks

Getting 10k steps a day is easily the best activity to do as a student. Exercise can be a gruelling thought; in fact, I've been feeling nauseous going to the gym lately. Maybe it's the B.O. in the air, but I've been avoiding it. Going on a walk around the neighbourhood is literally a breath of fresh air.

# Blueberry Breakfast Oatmeal

Such a great indulgent breakfast. Usually I opt for a savoury, protein-rich breakfast to keep me satiated until lunch. But this blueberry oatmeal is a good option on days I need a treat. Although I used rolled oats in the picture below, I've since switched to steel-cut instead. Also this blueberry oatmeal Jellycat is the most adorable thing I've ever seen. I just want to gobble him up.

I want to give you a recipe, but I honestly eyeball everything. I just add oats to a pot of boiling water, then simmer until the desired texture and the water is boiled off. Add vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a sweetener. Add your oats to a bowl and add frozen blueberries. So easy and so good.

# I'll Never Be French (no matter what I do) _Mark Greenside_

On train rides and comfortable nights I've been reading this. It's an autobiographical re-telling of Mark Greenside's journey in Brittany, France. From arriving at the airport, to purchasing bread, the descriptions of daily French life sounds effortlessly enjoyable. It's strategically broken up, making it easy to pick up and put down without getting lost.

# Kale Salad

Scrumptious, easy, and healthy, what more could I ask for? This kale salad has been a great meal prep lunch. I can easily prepare the base (ingredients below) and add my protein of choice. I typically go for eggs or salmon.

- Sun-dried tomatoes
- Protein: Jammy, soft-boiled eggs or pan-fried salmon
- Dressing: olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper

# University Campus

The more time I spend on campus the more I appreciate it. Just walking to class is beautiful. Now that it's autumn, I have to take full advantage of the weather and spend time outside.
