Christmas after Christmas, my favourite part is writing and receiving handwritten letters. It feels so special to have real words from the people you love. On February 14, 2022, I received my first and only Valentine that year. I opened the puffy, white envelope to reveal a fancy card. The kind with raised, colourful styrofoam. Inside, my father wrote just one sentence. I still reread the card every couple of weeks. I love that he took the time to choose the perfect card, write meaningful words, and wrap it in an envelope so delicately. 

_To All the Boys I've Loved Before_ permanently changed how I thought about letters. I remember watching that movie for the first time and loving how Lara Jean puts so much effort into them. Since then, she has inspired me to write more. I've even upgraded to wax letter stamps -- fancy, I know. I now find any opportunity to write to someone.

Handwritten letters are so extraordinary, they shouldn't just be reserved for birthdays and Christmas. We should write letters of love to all our family and friends, just because.
