Welcome to my dorm room! It isn't exactly the cutest ever, but I like it. When I first moved in, I felt out of place so I filled it with things that felt familiar and represented home.

On my desk, I have a small Metskiie print and a school poster to keep me motivated. I also keep my singular, unnecessary textbook, as well as some magazines and books.

I have some new additions to my magazine collection. _Elle_ November 2023 featuring Irina Shayk and _Harper's Bazaar_ art issue featuring Lana Del Rey.

I'm currently reading _INVENTION: A Life_ by James Dyson, which was gifted to me by my brother, Sebastian. He also gifted me _Ritz &amp; Escoffier: The Hotelier, The Chef &amp; the Rise of the Leisure Class_ by Luke Barr. I haven't read print in ages besides newspapers, so it's nice to have physical books again.

My posters are from the campus poster sale. They honestly look kind of weird because I just smacked them on the wall with some tape. But it's better than a blank wall.

Last, but not least is my copious amount of tea. I told my brother, Jonathan, that I liked matcha once, and now he has sponsored nearly my entire collection. I have an assortment of english, green, and peppermint tea at my disposal.
