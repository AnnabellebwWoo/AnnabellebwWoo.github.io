Whether it's for your Mom or your coworker, I have put together the ultimate gift guide for her this holiday season. This is the first year I'm giving actual gifts to my family. So after hours of research, I have decided to share my collected research to you. Personally, I'm tired of seeing bathrobes and mugs on these so-called "best" gift guides. Gifting is more than just exchanging goods, it's about [hey man, I love you this many dollars worth](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpewdiepie.getyarn.io%2Fyarn-clip%2F746d08de-05a9-4e01-983f-4f4db2c45b3d%2Fgif&psig=AOvVaw1BFXAarnsLCpjLgxcEInlG&ust=1760030484162000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCOjN49GOlZADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAL). Gifting is just a nice way to show that person that they deserve to treat themselves. Below, the best gifts for the girl(s) in your life.

# Cocktail Glasses

# Reformer Pilate Classes

Treat them to some fun workout classes, better yet, treat both of you. Any type of class can be another fun way to hang out.

# Adidas Sambas

In my opinion, one of the cutest shoes on the market right now. They're versatile and functional.

# Books

# Ballet Tickets

Another fun way to spend an evening together. Especially during the holiday season, catching _The Nutcracker_ and getting a nice dinner is an excellent way to spend a fancy evening.

# Monogramed Toiletry Bag

Monogrammed anything is a great gift. It's functional and has a personal touch. Especially these toiletry bags, which will make traveling feel luxurious.

# Crown Affair Comb

Another way to gift some luxury to someone you love (or like). It seems like everyone and their mother are on a hair care journey in 2023. Let that bleed into 2024 with a fancy comb to step up their routine.

# Nécessaire Body Set

With all of these in mind, don't forget the most important part; the letter. The letter is the ultimate and true gift to me. Even if you have a zero dollar budget, write something honest and kind. I promise it will make them melt.
