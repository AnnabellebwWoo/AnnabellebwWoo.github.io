While not everything on this list was released in 2023, they were the most used, loved, and memorable parts. So much has happened this past year, it's hard to believe that I was in high school just months ago. So much growth has occured, and I'm excited to see what's to come for 2024. For now, here are some tangible favourites of the year.

# Album: Folklore

_Folklore_ released in 2020, but I listened to it non-stop in 2023. It's my favourite Taylor Swift album and requires no skips. Recently, _Hoax_ has been my favourite track, but _the 1_ will always be my first choice.

# Makeup: Milk Makeup Lit Highlighter

This highlighter gives a nice glow for my everyday routine. I don't wear it everyday, but it gives me a boost when I need it in the morning.

# Lip Balm: Aquaphor

Since going on accutane, aquaphor has been my saviour. I reapply every hour without fail.

# Fragrance: Giorgio Armani Sì Eau de Parfum

I've been wearing Sì since as long as I can remember. I don't wear fragrance everyday because it's irritating for others around me. But on special occasions, it reminds me of all the amazing memories I've made while wearing it.

# Movie: Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret

This movie is so sweet it made me melt so many times throughout. It's so representative of growing up and niche experiences as a girl. I didn't know I could look up to an eleven year old so much.

I have so many movies on my watch list, like _Priscilla_, _The Iron Claw_, and the new _Hunger Games_ movie. (Please let me know if they're good, I've been dying to watch them!!!)

# Show: The Summer I Turned Pretty, Season 2

The show was so entertaining, but my favourite party was sitting down with my sister and parents every week to watch the new episode. My parents gave the best commentary, so watching with them was the best experience. My mom even made a lobster dinner for my eighteenth birthday inspired by the show.
