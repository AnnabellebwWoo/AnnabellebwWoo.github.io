With school back in session, I thought it would be nice to share my favourite movies to get into the school mentality. Below are some of my favourites for when I need a little boost.

# Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)

Okay, this is kind of embarrassing to admit, but every time I feel overwhelmed with school, I listen to [Sunflower by Post Malone](https://open.spotify.com/track/3KkXRkHbMCARz0aVfEt68P?si=bc023a9c959d499c). Yeah, I know, it's kind of derivative, but Spider-Man is extremely motivating.

# Dead Poets Society (1989)

What a great movie for romanticising university. A seriously stunning movie with a moving message. Enough to make a person wonder if engineering is worth it. (haha just joking, i love engineering...)

# Legally Blonde (2001)

Watching Elle Woods become the best version of herself is so satisfying. I love how she makes lifestyle changes because she has the drive to succeed and doesn't care about what others think.

# Monsters University (2013)

Yeah okay, maybe when I thought of this blog post idea I thought there would be more. I watched this movie within my first week of school and it was exactly what I needed. During a time when I felt a very icky, homesick feeling, this felt very familiar and warm. _Monsters University_ makes me feel like it's okay to be a nerd.
