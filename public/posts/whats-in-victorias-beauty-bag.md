Editor's Note: This blog post is inspired by my two favourite beauty interview styles of all time: _Harper's Bazaar's Inside my beauty bag_ and _Into The Gloss' The Top Shelf_. I like how _Harper's Bazaar_ allows an intimate inside scoop on the interviewee's beauty bag. I also enjoy how _Into The Gloss_ has a bunch of paragraphs from the interviewee themselves in a casual style. Their interviews allow everyone's personality to shine through which is sometimes hard to achieve.

Depending on how much time I have I add more stuff. My most basic routine is just curling my lashes and [mascara](https://www.lorealparis.ca/en-ca/voluminous/voluminous-curved-brush-mascara-black-brown). But usually most days, it's curling my lashes, mascara, the [benefit blush](https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/benetint-cheek-lip-stain-P1272?skuId=2264638&icid2=products%20grid:p1272:product) — which I dot on my cheeks and tap with my fingers. Of course, skincare is the most important thing to me. So I try not to overload it. I don't do any base makeup. At most, it's just curl lashes, mascara, same thing with the blush, and then eye makeup? Maybe like I take the [little bite eyeshadow](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bite-size-eyeshadow/21151.html) and I just put a little smokiness near my lash line and then I would take my [brown eye pencil](https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/huda-beauty-creamy-kohl-longwear-eye-pencil-P504900?skuId=2651826&icid2=products%20grid:p504900:product). Then if I feel a little fancy I add a little fox thing in the front. Lips ... I don't really have like a beauty lip product, I just switch between a lot of different lip balms. _Especially_ my favourite is [that Korean one](https://tocobo.us/collections/lip-balm/products/glow-ritual-lip-balm-001-coral-water?variant=43232521421036).

**Now for some rapid fire ...**

**A: What is the best beauty tip you've ever received?**

V: I guess overall is about sunscreen. Skincare is more important. Just, sun is the only thing that ages you.

**A: What is the last beauty product you have completely finished?**

V: I don't think I've every finished a beauty product...

**A: Okay great, next question ... Finish the sentence: "When I wake up, the first thing I do is ... "**

V: Probably brush my teeth.

**A: "Before I go to sleep, I ... "**

V: Kiss my Ice Bear

Note: interviewee's stuffed animal is "Ice Bear"

**A: "An essential part of my beauty routine is ... "**

V: These aren't really rapid fire. I feel like rapid fire is like, hot or cold?

**A: Yeah this is kinda difficult.**

V: Um ...

**A: Um ...**

V: Wait what was the question?

**A: Uh. It's okay you don't have to answer that one. That's boring. Give a hair product that you swear by.**

V: _Yawn_ I don't know if it actually works, but I'm a big fan of getting a little bit of castor oil in your fingers and massaging your head before you sleep.

**A: What is your favourite way to unwind?**

V: I think going on walks.

**A: Do you have any beauty regrets?**

V: I do. My mascara. I purchased a lot of the brown ones.

**A: Oh yeah I know.**

V: So, beauty regrets -- unintentional beauty regrets -- accidentally getting the waterproof one, accidentally getting the wrong brush ...

**A: Yeah I know because I have to drive you every time.**

V: I think I actually did get the black one time, yeah I got the brown one, and then I got the black one, and the waterproof, and the curved brush.

**A: Early mornings or late nights?**

V: Early mornings.

**A: Eyes or lips?**

V: Eyes.

**A: Trainers or heels?**

V: Trainers. Heels can be fun, I like heels.

**A: Style or comfort?**

V: Comfort.

**A: Backpack or handbag?**

V: Backpack, always! I don't even own a handbag!

**A: Haha I know. Hair up or hair down?**

V: Hair down.

**A: Pants or a dress?**

V: Ooh, I do like both. But I wear pants a lot more. The dress I really do like. I think it's even.

**A: Laptop or phone?**

V: Laptop.

**A: Ooh laptop or headphones. If you have the headphones you obviously have some sort of device.**

V: OOH! I feel so crippled when I use my laptop without my headphones. But I'll say laptop.

**A: Cats or dogs?**

V: Cats!

**A: Makeup or natural?**

V: Natural

**A: Perfume or eau de toilette?**

V: I don't even know the difference _haha_.

**A: Oh. _haha_ okay.**

V: _YAWN_

**A: What is your favourite colour?**

V: Purple always. I like all purple except for mauve.

**A: What is your favourite beauty brand?**

V: Ooh Saie. I love Saie.

**A: Who is your celebrity crush?**

V: Danny Jansen

**A: Where do you like to shop for clothes?**

V: Calvin Klein. I like Calvin Klein. I like Oak + Fort. Sometimes Aerie.

I really like having a really clean routine. It gets really convenient when you're going somewhere, like a friend's house or travelling. You just slap it on really easily. I know I said early mornings over late nights. Early mornings are great, I'm just not great at getting there. _Laughs_. So I'm always late, so it helps to have a really simple routine.

My aura buzzwords: I really like the word buzzwords. Just put in brackets here, "cracks up laughing at her own joke". _Cracks up laughing at her own joke_.
