To start, I'd like to preface this post for it's out-of-order and somewhat scrambled nature. You'll see why below.

I've been reading [Vitalik Buterin's](ttps://vitalik.eth.limo/) and [Terence Tao's](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) blogs lately, and I find it funny that they have such bare-bones websites. (Also, isn't it funny that Terrence Tao still uses a WordPress domain?) In contrast, my blog is more visually focused; I prioritize making it as "pretty" as possible. But reading their posts has been refreshing. I don't always follow everything they're saying, but having pure text and writing straight from the mind is nice. In fact, that's why I started blogging in the first place.

I was inspired to start by fashion magazines and other blogs. I love reading the words that speak to the individual—it feels so much more intimate and genuine. I don't necessarily want my blog and website to be focused on visuals along, but rather a platform to express myself creatively and maybe let off some stress.

I'm not always as active with blogging as I'd like to be. They seem to write so frequently; not only that, but they also reply to comments and keep up with their work. I post maybe once a month, and I'm merely a university student. They seem to write straight from their minds, and it has inspired me to do the same.

As much as I'd like to be more active, I honestly get stuck sometimes. Whether its coming up with valid ideas, choosing pictures, or just getting the motivation to sit down and write, it can be challenging. I actually come up with blog ideas fairly often and have a couple drafts of discarded ideas. It's not that they're bad—more that I don't feel they're interesting or readable. Other times, I feel insecure about have completely clean, grammar-free writing.

Blogging has always been fun, and I'd like to continue, but I get too hung up on visuals and making it "perfect". If I've learned anything since coming to university, it's that perfection is overrated. There's no such thing anyway.

Blogging for me shouldn't be a glamorous, polished endeavour, but something I do for the sake of writing. Getting hung up on visuals is exhausting and a waste of time, especially if it's going to hold me back from creating what I want. I'm going to start dedicating myself to blogging for the sake of writing and sharing instead of creating content I think will appeal to the masses.
