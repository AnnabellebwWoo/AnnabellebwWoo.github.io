I looooove Valentine's day. I love heart decorations. I love putting a little extra blush in the morning. I love pink desserts. I love [love songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Kg4zonekQBRONwVyQchy9?si=275e876bc94e469d). I love bouquets of flowers. I love, love. 

It's not even relevant to have a romantic valentine. It's just a beautiful holiday to celebrate all of the love in your life. What is sweeter than that? It's so cute to see people stroll by with a certain look in their eyes or with flowers and chocolates in their hands to be delivered. 

This Valentine's day, I'm going to spend it studying physics. But I watched some of Celine Song's _Past Lives (2023)_. I've heard so much about it on Instagram and TikTok. I'm still at the thirty minute mark, but it's already tearing at my heart strings. I'll definitely finish the movie after midterms, and I can't wait.

I hope you all have or had an amazing Valentine's day, regardless if you have a romantic partner or not. Definitely treat yourself to flowers and chocolates because you deserve it.
