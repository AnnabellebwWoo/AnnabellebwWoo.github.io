Lignin is a naturally abundant polymer as a waste product from industrial and agricultural processing. With it's sun-blocking attributes, there is a great amount of interest in exploring it's commercial applications in cosmetics and food.

- dual-modified lignin sub-microsphere boosts spf of sunscreens and improves their colour (more effective and aesthetically appealing)
- lignin is uv-absorbing and has antioxidant properties, but in sunscreens had low spf and dark colour. then researchers modified its chemical structure and physical form (attached methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetrameythylbutylphenol (MBTT) to alkali lignin (AL) to make new polymer AL-g-MBTT) to turn into tiny spheres some with and some without titantium dioxide (TiO2)
    - unmodified AL had 4.74 SPF and 49.5 ΔE
    - 10% AL-g-MBBT3 had 42.93 SPF and 45.6 ΔE (big increase, also lighter in colour so better for cosmetics)
