I was scrolling on Instagram when I came across a post and oh my god. I saw a slideshow of Lily-Rose Depp for <i>The Idol</i>. \*\*Before Sam Levinson took over as director for Amy Seimetz. I loved the Britney Spears, fun essence.

Note: I was checking back on this post and the original Instagram post was deleted. So I had to dig for these grainy images.

This made me consider what other parts of the 2000s that I love. Something about the 2000s embraced being a teenager. The talking on the phone, going to the mall, going to concerts. But some things need a revival, and one of my favourite parts is fashion magazines. I love my magazine collection, albeit a small one. I really only have two, but they have my whole heart.

My first is Harper's Bazaar's September "The Icons" issue. It's full of my favourite "icons". Hailey Bieber, Emma Chamberlain, Mika Schneider, and Florence Pugh. Also it was a dollar cheaper than that month's Vogue. When I first got it, I dissected and absorbed every single page. I loved having a physical entity to hold onto for my then-current fixation.

My second is Elle's December/January issue featuring Lily-Rose Depp and Jennie. I didn't realize it then, but they were promoting <em>The Idol</em>. I also basically inhaled this magazine. I especially admired the edits they put together like "Midwest Modern," "Miami Art Deco," "French Baroque," "Uptown Brutalism," and "English Tudor." Each had meticulously laid out clothing pieces, beauty products, and decor that represented each niche.

Something about being a teenager today feels so uptight. Maybe it's the internet and the access to impossibly high standards. More than magazines and concerts, the 2000s was just about having fun. For all of high school, all I could think about was, "What would these people think about what I wear, what I say, how I sound, what I eat, how much I eat". So praise for the 2000s lifestyle and aesthetic. It inspires me to have more fun and care less about what other people think. Do what you truly love.

If you're reading this: mwah mwah I appreciate you more than you know.
