Bags are custom to every individual, that it’s so intimate finding what others keep in theirs. I love discovering everyone’s favorite items that go beyond the beauty world. Here I’m sharing what I keep in mine.

My bag is the black shoulder bag from [Brandy Melville](https://us.brandymelville.com/products/mini-faux-leather-purse). I find it’s the perfect bag that goes with most any outfit.

## Essentials

*[Wallet](https://www.clutchhealdsburg.com/products/lodis-card-holder)*

No explanation necessary.

*Hand Sanitizer*

After COVID, this is non-negotiable.

*Phone*

Also, no explanation necessary.

*Hair Tie*

An easy hairstyle in a pinch during a windy day.

## Beauty

*[Kosas Lip Oil- Jellyfish](https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/lip-oil-P451920?skuId=2297505&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p451920:product)*

Dry lips are my biggest pet peeve-- if I happen to forget my lip oil then I’m scouring for a huge bottle of water.

*[It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye Concealer- 20.0 Medium](https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/bye-bye-under-eye-full-coverage-anti-aging-waterproof-concealer-mini-P446901?skuId=2224053&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p446901:product)*

You never know when you need a touch up, and this mini size fits in my bag perfectly.

## Miscellaneous

*Pocket Mirror*

To make sure I look decent when a bathroom isn’t in my proximity.

*[Pen](https://muji.ca/collections/pens-pencils/products/wooden-mechanical-pen)*

Always handy.

*[Airpods](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MQD83AM/A/airpods-pro?fnode=d2ddc7a306450c651694de68e41b0f1c1dffccb745f654d8d535650ff7f7c71a457bbb562dde5e23986a0a11e4fc0bea25adbe2cdd27b81d8dadefd6a4e1fa3669f99b628632e4f0db42987cb5c33ba2fe1652d961dcd34b2ceda4963c9a00d3b2ad6fd170e1390ee67425157153953341deb2d2ca6a095562544bd7a60e196f&amp;fs=f%3Dapple-overear-sport%26fh%3D47d1%252B3214%252B45aa%252B45ab)*

Waiting in line, avoiding droning small talk, you know, the usual.
