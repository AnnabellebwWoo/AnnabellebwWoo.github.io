I recently made this tiramisu recipe and I can't find it anywhere so I'm sharing it here. Tiramisu seems like a complicated dessert, but it's actually very simple. It's made up of layers of ladyfingers, coffee, and a cream. If you want to go the full mile, then make your own ladyfingers. But otherwise, impress all your friends and family with this easy tiramisu.

*Ingredients*

- 2 Packs Lady Fingers
- 3 Eggs
- 60g Granulated Sugar
- 300g Mascarpone Cheese
- 1 Cup Strong Coffee 
- 2 Tablespoons Liqueur (of your choice)
- Cocoa Powder

*Steps*
1. Separate the whites and yolks of the eggs.
2. Cream together the egg yolks and sugar.
3. Mix in the mascarpone cheese with the egg and sugar mixture.
4. Mix together the coffee and liqueur.
5. Layer the ladyfingers flat in a medium sized dish. Dribble the coffee mixture onto each ladyfinger. Spread the mascarpone mixture on top. Repeat until the dish is filled. Usually about 2-3 layers.
6. Finish off the cake with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.
